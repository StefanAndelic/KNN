k-Nearest Neighbor machine learning algorithm and its evaluation on an adjusted iris data set taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository 

This repository contains code for k-Nearest Neighbor algorithm written in Java and classifies each instance in the test set iris-test.txt according to the training set iris-training.txt.  To run the program execute the available KNN.jar file (e.g. java -jar KNN.jar iris-training.txt iris-test.txt 3) where 3 is the number of neighbors user wants to classify through the command line Alternatively add the jar file or the provided source code into a Java IDE (e.g. eclipse) and run the program by adjusting the path to text files or program by going to run/run configurations and add the names of training and test files plus number of neighbors into the arguments box.
